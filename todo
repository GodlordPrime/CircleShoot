TO DO:

-Add TODO comments

-Split up large functions

-Remove any unused variables

-Rework the horrendous classes

-Better comments because they kinda suck ass

-Maybe split up index.js into more files instead

-More stuff

-Create universal function that takes in elements
as input and sets their display style to 'none'

-General renaming of variables

-Universal function that takes in an object
and returns its position

-Restructure/reorganize code into better places
(code relating to enemy should all be in inside enemy)
